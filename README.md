# Podéx
Podéx is a mobile application that stores Pokémon information locally on your device so you can look up data while playing without switching to a browser or dealing with ads. It acts like a quick reference guide, just like the original Pokédex in the game — but more detailed.

# 🔥 Why Podéx was made
- Because emulator players often struggle with:
- Switching between game → browser → game
- Turning internet on/off
- Ads that interrupt focus
- Forgetting the tips after ads appear
- Podéx solves that by staying offline, fast, and clean.

# 📌 What Podéx contains
It provides:
- Pokémon stats
- Evolutions
- Moves
- Types
- Strengths & weaknesses
- Basic item info
- Location references (where Pokémon can be found)
- Everything is stored in the app

# 📡 No Internet Required
All data is:
- Pre-loaded
- Lightweight
- Offline-accessible
- Meaning you can use it anywhere — on the bus, at school, or when you have no Wi-Fi/data.

# 🎮 Who is it for?
Perfect for:
- Emulator players
- Retro fans
- Speedrunners
- Casual players needing quick info

**A modern, offline, ad-free Pokédex for the classic Pokémon Gen 1 games — built to make gameplay easier, smoother, and more enjoyable.**
